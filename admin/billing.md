## Overview

- **Subscription**: Shows whether the kennel is in **trial** or **active** status. Trials include the remaining time; active shows the current plan.
- **Recent invoices**: Quick view of latest invoices with amounts, dates, and statuses. Actions include paying outstanding invoices and viewing details.
- **Payment methods**: Lists cards or bank accounts on file and whether a default exists.

## Invoices

- View all invoices with **invoice number**, **date**, **amount**, and **status** (e.g., paid, open, past due).
- Open invoices include a **Pay** action; paid invoices include **View** for details/receipts.
- Invoice detail pages link related payments and line items when available.

## Payment Methods

- Manage cards/bank accounts used for billing.
- Add or update methods; set a default to ensure renewals succeed.
- Removing a payment method that is in use prompts you to choose another default first.

## How billing works

1. **Subscription state** is either trial (time-limited) or active (paid).
2. **Payments** are collected via saved payment methods; each successful charge generates a payment record.
3. **Invoices** reflect charges and payments. Paying an open invoice updates its status immediately and links to the payment method used.

Tips:
- Keep at least one valid payment method on file to avoid service interruption.
- Pay open invoices promptly; retry failed payments from the invoice actions.
- Download receipts from invoice details for bookkeeping.
