## What to include
- The problem or need (what’s hard today).
- Who it impacts (role/kennel size/use case).
- Examples or screenshots of the workflow.
- Desired outcome (what “good” looks like).

## Examples of good feedback
- “When scheduling runs, selecting a run site is slow because the list isn’t searchable. Please add search by name.”
- “Need a way to export members with custom fields for our annual audit; ideally CSV with gender and join date.”
- “Menu reorder should allow collapsing sections; with 20+ links it’s hard to drag.”

## How to send
- Use the feedback channel or contact support with subject **“Feedback”**.
- Include links/IDs (run #, member short name) and screenshots when possible.
- We may reach out for details or mockups.
