> Uses roles to control which users can manage members, runs, content, billing, and settings. Assign only what each person needs.

## Roles
- **Owner**: Full access to everything, including billing, domains, settings, and deleting/transfer actions. Can invite others and assign any role.
- **Admin**: Manage runs/events, members, pages, and menu. Can handle most day-to-day operations; billing/settings only if granted by Owner.
- **Hare Raiser**: Create and edit runs/events, attach GPX/photos, manage run sites. No billing or member admin.
- **Hash Cash**: Billing and finance (view/pay invoices, manage plans). No content or member admin unless also assigned.
- **On Sec**: Member directory, invites, roles (within allowed scope). No billing or site content unless also assigned.
- **Scribe**: Pages and menu content (create, edit, publish). No billing or member admin.

## Best practices
- Use least privilege; assign only what’s needed.
- Members can hold multiple roles.
- Review roles periodically and after team changes.

## How to assign roles
1) Open **Administration → Users & Roles**.
2) Find the member and edit roles.
3) Save and confirm updated access.
