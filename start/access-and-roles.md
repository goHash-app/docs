## Roles
- **Owner**: Full access to everything, including billing, domains, settings, and deleting/transfer actions. Can invite others and assign any role. Role can not be removed by others. Owner can transfer the ownership to another admin.
- **Admin**: Full access to everything, including billing, domains, settings, and deleting/transfer actions. Can invite others and assign any role. But Admin role can be removed by owner.
- **Hare Raiser**: Only access to create and edit runs/events, attach GPX/photos, manage run sites.
- **Hash Cash**: Only access to Billing and finance (view/pay invoices, manage plans).
- **On Sec**: Only access to Members
- **Scribe**: Only access to Pages and menu content (create, edit, publish).

## Best practices
- Use least privilege; assign only what’s needed.
- Members can hold multiple roles.
- Review roles periodically and after team changes.
