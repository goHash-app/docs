> Key concepts you’ll use across GoHash: kennels, runs/events, members, users, and roles.
{.is-info}

## Kennel
- Your home in GoHash (for your Hash Kennel or Chapter).
- Holds members, runs/events, content, and settings.

## Runs & Events
- **Runs**: Scheduled runs with run sites, date/time, and run details (report, photos, GPX track, notes).
- **Events**: Specific event hosted by the kennel (event information, schedule, pricing).
- **Run sites**: Saved run locations you can reuse when scheduling runs.

## Members
- Members of your kennel (active and inactive).
- Member data: name, hash name, contact details, joined date, etc

## Users
- People with a GoHash account who can sign in and manage a kennel.
- A user can belong to multiple kennels.
- Users hold roles that define their permissions.

## Roles
Control what each user can do in the portal.
- Common roles:
  - **Owner**: Full access, billing, settings, domains.
  - **Admin**: Full access, billing, settings, domains (but has no ownership).
  - **Hare Raiser**: Create/edit runs & events.
  - **Hash Cash**: Billing and finance.
  - **On Sec**: Member management.
  - **Scribe**: Pages and menu content.
> Members can have multiple roles; use least-privilege where possible.

# Typical flow
1) Create or join your kennel.
2) Owners or admins configure the kennel settings and manage billing.
3) Invite users (committee or volunteers) and assign roles.
4) Users can manage runs, events, members, pages (depending on the assigned roles).
