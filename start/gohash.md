# Key concepts

## Kennel
- Your home in GoHash (for your Hash Kennel or Chapter).
- Holds members, runs/events, content, and settings.

## Runs & Events
- **Runs**: Scheduled gatherings with location, date/time, and trail details (attach GPX, photos, notes).
- **Events**: Activity stream entries tied to runs (status changes, announcements, updates).
- **Run sites**: Saved start locations you can reuse when scheduling runs.

## Members
- Members of your kennel (Active and inactive).
- Member data: hash name, full name, contact details, joined date, etc

## Roles
Control what each member can do in the portal.
- Common roles:
  - **Owner**: Full access, billing, settings, domains.
  - **Admin**: Full access, billing, settings, domains (but has no ownership).
  - **Hare Raiser**: Create/edit runs & events.
  - **Hash Cash**: Billing and finance.
  - **On Sec**: Member management.
  - **Scribe**: Pages and menu content.
> Members can have multiple roles; use least-privilege where possible.

# Typical flow
1) Create or join your kennel.
2) Owners or admins configure the kennel settings and manage billing.
3) Invite users (committee or volunteers) and assign roles.
4) Users can manage runs, events, members, pages (depending on the assigned roles).
