# Logging in

- **Invites**: Accept the invite email to create or link your GoHash account.
- **Account setup**: Set password and confirm email to activate.
- **Email verification**: Verify to access member-only areas and invites.
- **Switching kennels**: Use the kennel switcher if you belong to multiple kennels.

## Troubleshooting
- Didn’t receive the invite? Check spam or ask an admin to resend.
- Email changed? Update via profile and re-verify.
