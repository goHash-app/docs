Manage your display name, memberships, email/password, and account controls in one place. Kennel owners cannot delete their account.

## Memberships & display name
- **Memberships**: See the kennels you belong to and your role in each.
- **Display name**: Update the name shown to members (hash name or preferred name).

## Email & password
- **Change email**: Update your login email and confirm via verification link.
- **Change password**: Enter current password, then set and confirm a new one.

## Sessions & account management
- **Log out all sessions**: Force sign-out on all devices for security.
- **Delete account**: Permanently remove your account (irreversible). **Owners of a kennel cannot delete their account**; transfer ownership first.

## Tips
- Keep your email verified to access the portal.
- Choose a strong password (12+ characters) and update it if compromised.
